function tea = Tea_Bot(tea)
%The Tea Bot is a charming AI that recommends tea based on your prior
%preferences. Tea Bot requires a matrix of values (tea) that includes columns
%for the day, time, and, types of tea. The test matrix is as follows:

 % Column 1 = Counter (keeps track of trial number)
    % 2 = Day (1:7 with 1 corresponding to Monday)
    % 3 = Time. Here, 1:3 correspond to morning, afternoon, and evening
    % What tea you have! I've coded my columns as follows:
    % 4 = Yorkshire Tea 
    % 5 = Yunnan Gold
    % 6 = Assam
    % 7 = Ruby Tea
    % 8 = Decaf Breakfast
    % 9 = Ginger
    % 10 = An option to refuse tea 
    
   %NB: these varieties were hard-coded based on the training data, but
   %could be user-defined in the function, creating a new column for each
   %new tea.
    
%Tea Bot will ask for the day, the time, and will make a suggestion based
%on your most common prior preference. You will then have the option to
%accept the suggestion, or select an alternative. Tea Bot will update its
%data based on these interactions.

%To begin:

%Add a new row for the current trial
rowToInsert = size(tea,1)+1;
rowVectorToInsert = [(size(tea,1)+1), zeros(1,size(tea,2)-1)];
%rowVectorToInsert = [(size(tea,1)+1), 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,0];
tea = [tea(1:rowToInsert-1,:); rowVectorToInsert; tea(rowToInsert:end,:)];

%Question the first. Takes user input and copies it to the dataset column
%for date
Day = input('What day is it? \n','s');
Day = double(Day); %converts character array to vector. Assumes days are capatalized
if Day(1) == 77 %Monday
    tea(size(tea,1),2)=1;
elseif Day(1)==84 && Day(2)==117 %Tuesday
    tea(size(tea,1),2)=2;
elseif Day(1)==87 %Wednesday
    tea(size(tea,1),2)=3;
elseif Day(1)==84 && Day(2)==104 %Thursday
    tea(size(tea,1),2)=4;
elseif Day(1)==70 %Friday
    tea(size(tea,1),2)=5;
elseif Day(1)==83 && Day(2)==97 %Saturday
    tea(size(tea,1),2)=6;
elseif Day(1)==83 && Day(2)==117 %Sunday
    tea(size(tea,1),2)=7;
end

Day = tea(size(tea,1),2); %Updates the data matrix with the current date

%Question the second. Takes user input and copies it to the dataset column
%for time
Time = input('Is it morning, afternoon, or evening? \n','s');
Time = double(Time); %Converts character to vector
if Time(1)== 77 || Time(1)== 109 %morning
    tea(size(tea,1),3)=1;
elseif Time(1)==65 || Time(1)==97 %afternoon
    tea(size(tea,1),3)=2;
elseif Time(1)==69 || Time(1)==101 %evening
    tea(size(tea,1),3)=3;
end
Time = tea(size(tea,1),3); %updates the matrix with the current time value

%Select the relevant rows based on date
X = tea(tea(:,2)== Day,:); %indexing the matrix by day
X = X(:,2:end); %subsetting the relevant columns

%Select relevant rows based on time
X = X(X(:,2)==Time,:);%indexing the remaining values by time

%replace the new row with zeroes to prevent any NaN errors
%X(size(X,1),1:end) = [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0];

X(size(X,1),1:end) = 0;

%calculate the probabilities
for i = 3:length(X) %looping through the relevant columns
    X(size(X,1),i)= sum(X(1:(size(X,1))-1,i))/(size(X,1)-1);%probabilty for each
end
%find the largest probability
[~, col] = find(ismember(X(end,:), max(X(end,:))));
if length(col)>1
    col = randsample(col,1);%if there's a tie, select randomly
elseif isnan(sum(col))
    col = randi([3,size(tea,2)]);% if there's an error, select randomly
else
    col = col;
end

if col<3 
    col = randi([3,size(tea,2)]);% there's no data, select randomly

% When specifying what tea you want instead, this assumes you're capitalizing the first letter. 
% To update the types of tea to what you drink, you'll need new numbers corresponding to the new names. 
% To get this, double('The name in single quotes') will give you the letters translated to numbers, 
% and you can replace the indices below:

     Alternative = double(Alternative);%converting answer into vector
